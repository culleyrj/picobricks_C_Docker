# picobricks_C_Docker
This is a project to create some code and dockerfile to develop C code for the raspberry pi pico under a docker container

## Docker file
The docker file I am using is from lukstep.  This is my starting point.

## Directions
The directions that I am following are from the Element14 website Working with Pi Pico C/C++ Projects Easily: A Docker Approach!  but the site recently went down.
